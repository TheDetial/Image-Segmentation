## Datasets
1„ÄÅCamvid-Tutorial  
The ori **[Camvid](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/)** data with the size of `960*720`. In this work, we used the camvid dataset in **[SegNet-Tutorial](https://github.com/alexgkendall/SegNet-Tutorial)** which named as `Camvid-Tutorial` in `12` classes with `480*360` size.
